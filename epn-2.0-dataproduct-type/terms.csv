ca;1;"Catalogue";"A catalogue of object parameters, of features, of resources, of events, etc. In EPNcore context, it is usually complemented by the dataproduct-type of the content (e.g.: with `sp` for a catalogue of spectra).";ivoasem:preliminary skos:related(http://www.ivoa.net/rdf/product-type#measurements) skos:related(http://www.ivoa.net/rdf/product-type#event-list)
ci;1;"Catalogue item";"Row or element of a catalogue. In EPNcore context, using this term implies that the row itself contains data, rather than an access_url pointing to the data.";ivoasem:preliminary
cu;1;"Cube";"Multidimensional data with 3 or more axes, e.g., all that is not described by other 3D data types such as spectral cube or volume.";ivoasem:preliminary skos:exactMatch(http://www.ivoa.net/rdf/product-type#cube)
ds;1;"Dynamic Spectrum";"Series of consecutive spectral measurements through time, organized primarily as a time series. This typically implies successive spectra of the same target / field of view.";ivoasem:preliminary skos:exactMatch(http://www.ivoa.net/rdf/product-type#dynamic-spectrum) skos:broader(#sp) skos:broader(#ts)
ev;1;"Event";"Individual event (e.g., formatted according to IVOA VOEvent standard).";ivoasem:preliminary
im;1;"Image";"Scalar field with two spatial axes, or association of several such fields, e.g., images with multiple color planes, from multichannel or filter cameras. Preview images (e.g. map with axis and caption) also belong here. Conversely, vectorial 2D fields are described as spatial_vector (sv).";ivoasem:preliminary skos:exactMatch(http://www.ivoa.net/rdf/product-type#image) skos:related(#sv) skos:related(#ma)
ma;1;"Map";"scalar field / rasters with two spatial axes covering a large area and projected either on the sky or on a planetary body, associated to spatial coordinate description and map projection parameters (with a short enumerated list of possible values); each pixel is associated to 2D coordinates. This is mostly intended to identify radiometrically calibrated and orthorectified images with complete coverage that can be used as reference basemaps.";ivoasem:preliminary skos:broader(#im)
mo;1;"Movie";"Sets of chronological 2D spatial measurements (consecutive images)";ivoasem:preliminary skos:exactMatch(http://www.ivoa.net/rdf/product-type#time-cube) skos:broader(#ts) skos:broader(#im)

sc;1;"Spectral Cube";"Sets of consecutive spectral measurements with 1D or 2D spatial coverage, e.g., imaging spectroscopy. The choice between `im` and `sc` is dictated by the characteristics of the instrument (which dimension is most resolved and which dimensions are acquired simultaneously). The choice between `ds` and `sc` is related to the uniformity of the field of view and by practices in the science field.";ivoasem:preliminary skos:exactMatch(http://www.ivoa.net/rdf/product-type#spectral-cube) skos:broader(#cu) skos:broader(#sp)
sp;1;"Spectrum";"Measurements organized primarily along a spectral axis, e.g., radiance spectra. This includes spectral aggregates (series of related spectral segments with non-connected spectral ranges, e.g., from several channels of the same instrument, various orders from an echelle spectrometer, composite spectra, SED, etc).";ivoasem:preliminary skos:exactMatch(http://www.ivoa.net/rdf/product-type#spectrum)
sv;1;"Spatial vector";"Vector information associated to localization, such as a spatial footprints, a GIS-related element, etc, e.g., a kml or geojson file. This includes maps of vectors, e.g., wind maps.";ivoasem:preliminary
ts;1;"Time Series";"Measurements organized primarily as a function of time (with exception of dynamical spectra and movies, i.e. usually a scalar quantity). Typical examples of time series include space-borne dust detector measurements, daily or seasonal curves measured at a given location (e.g., a lander), and light curves.";ivoasem:preliminary skos:exactMatch(http://www.ivoa.net/rdf/product-type#timesseries)
vo;1;"Volume";"Measurements with 3 spatial dimensions, e.g., internal or atmospheric structures, including shells/shape models (3D surfaces).";ivoasem:preliminary skos:broader(#cu)
