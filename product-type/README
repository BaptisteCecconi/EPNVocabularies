This vocabulary started its life as a "half-closed" enumeration in
Obscore 1.0 and Obscore 1.1, http://ivoa.net/documents/ObsCore/20170509/

It was turned into a proper vocabulary when it was realised that these
types are useful far beyond that (such as in content parameters to media
types or to declare data products returned by SSAP services).  The
initial version of this vocabulary matches very closely the list given
in Obscore 1.1.
