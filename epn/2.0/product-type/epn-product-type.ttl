    dc:description """The EPNcore product-type parameter describes the high level
scientific organization of the data product linked by the access_url parameter, or
directly included in the table (in which case the value is 'ci' for catalogue_item).
EPNCore currently defines several types listed below. The data provider must select
the type most adapted to his data. In complex situations (e. g., when a file contains
several data products), several types can be used to describe the same granule by
using a hash-separated-list — although using several granules to describe the file
content may be a better solution. In EPN-TAP these types are identified by a
2-characters ID, so that multivalued queries are unambiguous.""";

            Catalogues can be provided as VOtable (possibly containing multiple tables, although
            this is not supported by SAMP). It is good practice to describe the type of data
            included in the catalogue using a hash-separated-list (e.g., a table of spectra should
            be described by ca#sp, so that it will respond to a query for spectra).""";

            limited to scalar quantities (including strings), and possibly to a single element.
            This organization allows the user to search inside the catalogue from the TAP query
