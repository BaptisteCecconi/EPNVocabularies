	for resources in the Virtual Observatory.  It is designed to
	enable discovery queries like "only research-level data" or
	"resources usable in school settings".

	Observatory in a very general manner.  Most actual services will
	be one of Archive, Catalog, or Survey.

path: voresource/relationship_type
timestamp: 2016-08-17
title: Relationship types in the VO
description: This vocabulary enumerates the kinds of relationships
	between VO resources that can be relevant in discovery or maintenance.
	Many of the terms are taken from the relationType enumeration in
	the DataCite metadata kernel.  Operationally important concepts
	missing there (e.g., served-by) were drawn from VOResource 1.0.

[datalink]
flavour:RDF Property
timestamp: 2014-10-30
title: Datalink core
description: Terms in this vocabulary relate (abstract) datasets to 
	files or other electronic artefacts, giving the relation between the two.
	They are originally intended for use in the semantics column in the output
	from the DataLink-1.0 {links} capability.  As specified in DataLink-1.0,
	terms from the vocabulary may be used in the Datalink output using only the
	fragment (e.g. #word) form (since this is the core vocabulary). We use this
	form below as the short form of the equivalent fully qualified term (e.g.
	http://www.ivoa.net/rdf/datalink/core#word).
