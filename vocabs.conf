[datalink]
flavour:RDF Property
timestamp: 2019-10-21
title: Datalink core
description: Terms in this vocabulary relate (abstract) datasets to 
	files or other electronic artefacts, giving the relation between the two.
	They are originally intended for use in the semantics column in the output
	from the DataLink-1.0 {links} capability.  As specified in DataLink-1.0,
	terms from the vocabulary may be used in the Datalink output using only the
	fragment (e.g. #word) form (since this is the core vocabulary). We use this
	form below as the short form of the equivalent fully qualified term (e.g.
	http://www.ivoa.net/rdf/datalink/core#word).
