coderived;1;Coderived Data;Data products sharing one or more progenitors with #this.  This could be a lightcurve for an object catalog derived from repeated observations, the dataset processed using a different pipeline, or the like.;ivoasem:preliminary

This could be observations of the same object in different wavelengths or along different axes (time, spectrum), but spectra of dust of common origin but different laboratories would be #counterparts as well.;ivoasem:preliminary
