This is a bridge between a curated list of observation facilities based
on Wikidata and IVOA vocabularies.

As of Dec 2023, the upstream sits on https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epn-vespa/FacilityList/master/data/obs-facilities_vocabulary/obs-facilities_vocabulary.json

This is written in a custom JSON serialisation of the relationships,
which we basically simply translate in our CSV.

This has exactMatch links in particular to Wikidata.  Over current
(V2.1) VocInVO2, we employ skos:altLabel relationships to give other
names that the facilities are known as; if we keep it that way, this
would need to be documented there.
