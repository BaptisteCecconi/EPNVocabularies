The content_level, content_type, date_role, and relationship_type terms
were historically created within VOResource; to maintain vocabulary
URIs, we keep them in a subdirectory.  This is *not* a recommendable
practice, as other users of these terms now have the odd "voresource"
in the vocabulary URIs.
