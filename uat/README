This is a technology study for a bridge between the UAT and IVOA
vocabularies.

The basic interest is:

* have IVOA-compatible URIs for UAT concepts; most importantly, we want
  readable concept URIs (BlackHole rather than 120)
* maintain format guarantees (have simple, revovo-readable XML).

The uat.skos file in here, although under version control, is *not* to
be changed or managed.  It is always generated from upstream UAT using
the uat2ivo.py script present here.

The actual conversion needs rapper installed.
