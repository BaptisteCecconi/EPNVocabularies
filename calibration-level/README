This vocubulary is based on the calibration levels as defined in Obcore1.1.

- Its purpose is to replace the MANGO literal enumeration for the calibration level of physical properties.
- Calibration-level vocabulary has one root which is specific for Obscore because it might be extended whith levels defined in 
  other standards (EPN-TAP2 CODMAC PSA  NASA  PDS). The equivalences between these are detailed in EPN-AP 2.0 section 2.1.2.
